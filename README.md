### SortingMethods 
 
 Sorting Methods is a Java program that sorts a input array using vaious sorting methods such  as election sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, hash(Bucket) sort, shell sort and ordered tree. 
 Comparision between the methods can be seen by analyzing the runtime. 
 
 Official project description can be found here: https://uoit.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-1294341-dt-content-rid-23221085_1/courses/20200173375.202001/ListofProjects.pdf
 
 ### Installation 
 
 Use package manager on PC to install SortingMethods. 
 
 ### Usage 
 
 import Sorting Methods project. 
 Expected Output would be the original array, sorted arrays with all 8 methods and runtimes for each. 
 
 Instructions:
 
     Input the desired values into the input.txt file or into personal file.
     Run Project9 file and insert number of desired items and name of the text tile.
     Terminal will show:
         Original array entered.
         Sorted array using all of the sorting methods.
         Run time for each sorting method.
         
 Example Output:
 
     Original array: [1, 2, 5, 19, 20, 3, 89, 7, 2]
      
     Hash (Bucket) sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Order Tree sort array: 1 2 3 5 7 19 20 89  
     Quick sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Selection sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Insertion sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Merge sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Shell sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
     Heap sort array: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 19, 20, 89]
      
     Hash Sort runtime: 901900
     Quick Sort runtime: 28919400
     Selection Sort runtime: 26244700
     Insertion Sort runtime: 460900
     Merge Sort runtime: 381500
     Shell Sort runtime: 2287200
     Heap Sort runtime: 2287200
